    steps:
      # 1. Set up the environment: Checks-out your repository, including the .env file
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18.x' # Specify the Node.js version
          cache: 'npm' # Cache npm dependencies for faster builds

      # 3. Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci # 'ci' is faster and more reliable for CI environments than 'install'

      # 4. Install Playwright browsers and system dependencies
      - name: Install Playwright Browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps

      # 5. Run Playwright Integration Tests
      # This command will use the .env file that was checked out with your code.
      # The ENV=QA prefix tells your script which variables to select from that file.
      - name: Run Playwright Integration Tests
        run: ENV=QA npx playwright test

      # 6. Upload Test Report as an Artifact
      # This step runs even if the previous steps fail, ensuring you always get a report.
